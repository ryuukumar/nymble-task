# Nymble - Firmware Task

This repository contains my attempt at the task provided by Nymble.

There are two folders:
- `arduino`: the source code for the MCU - in this case, ATMEGA328P on the Arduino UNO
- `pc`: the source code for the sender/receiver on the PC

The build and run instructions, as well as any accompanying documentation, is provided in README files in both the folders. I strongly urge you to read those before reading or attempting to run the code.
